<p>In Om, we have two facilities for passing data into our components:</p>

<ol>
<li>Passing data in options directly to a component,</li>
<li>accessing application state.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, the first option is probably the closest to the React
version.</p>

<p>Let's start by rendering two <code>comment</code> components (we'll define the
component itself afterwards) and define the <code>author</code> and <code>text</code>
properties as options.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn comment-list [app]
  (om/component
   (dom/div #js {:className "commentList"}
            (om/build comment app {:opts {:author "Pete Hunt"
                                          :text "This is one comment"}})
            (om/build comment app {:opts {:author "Jordan Walke"
                                          :text "This is *another* comment"}}))))
</code></p>

<h2><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html#using-props">Using Props</a></h2>

<p>Let's define our <code>comment</code> component. Now, instead of just taking
<code>app</code> (the cursor) as an argument, we'll also take <code>opts</code> (and
destructure them).</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn comment [app owner {:keys [author text] :as opts}]
  (om/component
   (dom/div #js {:className "comment"}
            (dom/h2 #js {:className "commentAuthor"} author)
            text)))
</code></p>

<p><code>opts</code> is one key of several that can be passed as the last argument
to <code>om/build</code>. We'll explore more of these later. Note, we have to
include the <code>owner</code> argument as the second argument.</p>
